    "# **Progress Report: Neural Network on Chip for Radar-based Human Presence Detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date:** June 24, 2025\n",
    "**Prepared by:** Pramoda S R\n",

    "## **Project Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to implement a dynamic neural network on-chip that can be reconfigured by flashing the network architecture and weights. This system aims to predict human presence using input from a radar sensor.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Current Progress**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Neural Network Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Architecture Implemented:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Input Layer:** 2 neurons\n",
    "  * **Hidden Layer:** 8 neurons (fully connected)\n",
    "  * **Output Layer:** 2 neurons (representing 2 hand gestures)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model Training:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Trained using test data from a previous project to simulate the real radar data pipeline.\n",
    "  * Activation Function: ReLU (hidden layer), Softmax (output layer)\n",
    "  * Loss Function: Cross-Entropy\n",
    "  * Optimizer: Adam\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Data Used**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inputs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `Data Field`: 2-byte hexadecimal value\n",
    "  * `Checksum`: 2-byte hexadecimal value\n",
    "  * Both fields are converted from hex to integer form before being used as model inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Note:** These fields represent the radar’s raw low-level signal indicators. Further validation of data relevance may be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Hardware-Oriented Weight Scaling**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Goal:** Reduce the precision requirement of weight/bias values to simplify analog/digital circuit implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Scaled weights and biases to a range with only 1–2 decimal places.\n",
    "  * Intention was to allow fixed-point or low-bitwidth representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Outcome:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Pros:** Potentially easier to implement in hardware.\n",
    "  * **Cons:** Significant drop in prediction accuracy observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Indicates potential need for alternative precision reduction strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Challenges**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Accuracy Loss:** Simplifying weight precision reduces model performance beyond acceptable thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Next Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Validate Data Source:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Collaborate with radar module experts to ensure the data fields used are meaningful for human detection.\n",
    "   * Explore preprocessing or additional radar parameters that may improve prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improve Hardware Feasibility:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Investigate quantization-aware training to maintain accuracy with low-precision weights.\n",
    "   * Consider using a hybrid analog-digital architecture for greater flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Configuration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Begin outlining the firmware architecture to accept and apply network configurations (shape + weights) on-chip.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "A working neural network prototype has been built and trained using simulated radar data. Initial hardware simplification has exposed accuracy challenges, and further tuning of both data relevance and model quantization is needed to progress toward chip-level deployment."
